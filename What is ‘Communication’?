What is ‘Communication’?

Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, or messages between individuals, groups, or organizations through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior. It involves the transmission, reception, and interpretation of information, and can take many forms, such as:

- Verbal communication (spoken language)
- Nonverbal communication (body language, facial expressions)
- Written communication (text, email, letters)
- Visual communication (images, videos)
- Interpersonal communication (face-to-face interaction)
- Mass communication (media, public speaking)

Effective communication involves clarity, accuracy, and understanding, and is essential for building relationships, resolving conflicts, and achieving goals in personal and professional settings.
