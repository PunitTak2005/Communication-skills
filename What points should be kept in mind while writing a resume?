 What points should be kept in mind while writing a resume?


When writing a resume, keep the following points in mind:

1. Tailor your resume: Customize your resume to match the requirements of the job you're applying for.
2. Use a clear format: Use a clean and easy-to-read format with bullet points and white space.
3. Highlight achievements: Emphasize your achievements and accomplishments rather than just listing job responsibilities.
4. Use keywords: Use relevant keywords from the job description to help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems (ATS).
5. Keep it concise: Keep your resume to one or two pages and focus on the most important information.
6. Use action verbs: Use action verbs like "managed," "created," "developed," and "improved" to describe your achievements.
7. Include relevant sections: Include relevant sections such as a summary or objective statement, education, work experience, skills, and certifications.
8. Proofread: Carefully proofread your resume to avoid spelling, grammar, and formatting errors.
9. Use a professional font: Use a professional font like Arial, Calibri or Helvetica.
10. Get feedback: Ask for feedback from friends, family, or a career counselor to improve your resume.
11. Update your resume regularly: Keep your resume up-to-date and review it regularly to ensure it accurately reflects your skills and experience.
12. Use numbers: Use numbers to quantify your achievements, such as "increased sales by 25% in 6 months".

Remember, the goal of a resume is to showcase your skills, experience, and achievements in a clear and concise manner, and to entice the reader to want to learn more about you.
