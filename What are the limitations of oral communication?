Oral communication, while effective in many situations, has some limitations:

1. Limited Retention: Spoken messages can be difficult to remember, and details may be forgotten.
2. No Permanent Record: Oral communication leaves no permanent record, making it difficult to reference later.
3. Susceptible to Distortion: Messages can be distorted or misinterpreted due to noise, emotions, or biases.
4. Limited Audience: Oral communication is typically limited to a small audience or one-on-one conversations.
5. Time-Consuming: Oral communication can be time-consuming, especially for complex or detailed information.
6. Difficult to Convey Complex Information: Oral communication can struggle to convey complex or technical information accurately.
7. Emotional Interference: Emotions can interfere with oral communication, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
8. Language Barriers: Oral communication can be hindered by language barriers or accents.
9. Feedback Challenges: Obtaining feedback or clarification can be difficult in oral communication.
10. Vulnerability to Misinterpretation: Oral communication is vulnerable to misinterpretation due to tone, pitch, and body language.

These limitations highlight the importance of using a combination of communication methods, including written communication, to ensure effective information exchange.
