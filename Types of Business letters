A business letter is a professional, formal letter that is sent by one company to another. These letters can be used for professional correspondence between business clients, employees, stakeholders as well as individuals .Whether you need to tell a potential client about your product, collaborate with another company, convince someone to attend your event, or give a thank you note-a well-written business letter can stand out.

Business letters can stand out. Business letters demonstrate a level of professionalism and class,  however, writing them becomes a tedious task when you are unfamiliar with the concept.

 

Types of Business Letters

1.       Cover Letters

First up, a cover letter is a one page document that candidates submit along with their resumes. It takes the employer on a guided journey of their greatest career and life achievements. No matter if you are a student or an experienced professional, a cover letter is an important document to show your skills, experience, and why you are fit for the position you are applying for.

 

Tips:

Don’t try to fit your whole career in your cover letter. It should have a carefully curated collection of stories.

Don’t state a skill that you don’t actually have. You’ll definitely regret when you are asked to use that skill in the interview.

Keep it concise and to the point. The employer does not have time to sit down and read an entire memoir.

 

Business Invites

These letters are a formal way to reach out to a company or an individual and invite them to attend an event hosted by your company. As business events tend to be formal, an invitation letter is most likely to be formal as well. But if you are organizing a casual event, it should be reflected in your invite and tone.

Tips:

 

Write the letter in such a way that it builds anticipation about the event.

Clearly mention the date, time and venue.

Set a friendly follow-up to remind them of the event.

 

Complaint Letter

This letter is a way to formally express your disappointment formally. You can report a bad experience, poor customer service, or let a company know that their products didn’t meet your expectations.

The key to this letter is that it shouldn’t sound like you are nagging, but also shouldn’t lose its importance if you want to be taken seriously.

If you’re in a high-profile position, consider your words super carefully because your letter would likely be made public.

Many times, people overlook the importance of writing persuasive business letters because the concept just doesn’t interest them. As a result of which, people don’t know how to write a business letter. Writing a clear and concise business letter isn’t a big deal, as long as you follow the established rules for layout and language.

 

How to write a Business Letter

 

Step 1: Sender’s Information

 

If you want a reply, you need to understand how to address a business letter properly.

In this section, you have to write your address, contact number, and email address.

Many people include their full name at the top too. However, others think that it’s unnecessary because you are going to sign the letter with name anyway. If your company has a letterhead, you can use that instead of typing out all the information.

 

Step2: Date

 

Rather than abbreviating with numbers, write the entire date. When you are writing to American companies, use the American date format i.e, put the month before the day. Example October20, 2023

 

Step 3: Recipient’s Address

 

This is the address where your letter will be delivered. Write the recipient’s name, their title (Ms./Mrs./Mr./Dr.), and their address. Make sure you are as specific as possible so that it reaches the right destination.

 

Tips:

In case you are unsure about a woman’s preference in being addressed, use ‘Ms.’

If  you think that your recipient uses ‘Dr.’ Or has some other title, use that. (Usually, people don’t mind being addressed by a higher title than they actually possess, but they don’t want to be addressed by a lower one. )

 

Step 4: The Salutation

 

A salutation isn’t just a simple greeting, it’s an indicator of respect. You can choose the salutation based on how well you know the person and the context of your letter.

If you know the person you’re sending the letter to, and you mostly address them with their first name in the salutation. (for example, Dear Mike) If you don’t know someone, always use the personal title and their last name. If you don’t know specifically whom you are sending the letter to, use “to whom it may concern”.

Whatever the situation is, make sure that you end the salutation with a colon. (Not a comma)
Step 5: The Body

 

This is the most important part of your letter. The body should contain a few (mostly three) concise paragraphs, each with a clear purpose. If you want your reader to get the best possible impression, keep the message crystal-clear.

In the opening paragraph, introduce yourself and clarify the point of your letter. You can also mention mutual connections here, in case the recipient doesn’t know who you are.

In the next paragraph, go into the details of your main point.

In the closing paragraph, briefly summarize your points, restate the letter’s purpose and tell your planned course of action.

 

Step 6: Closing

 

Here you will mention that the recipient can contact you or your team if he has any concerns or questions. You can also thank him or her for reading the letter. Make sure that the closing is not more than two sentences long.

 

Step 7: Complimentary Closing

 

This is a short remark that marks the end of your letter. You have got a lot of options here but choose the one that reflects the formality of your relationship

Recommended formal closings include “yours  Truly” or “Regards”

Regardless of what you choose, add a comma at the end.

 

Step 8: Signature

 

Below the complimentary close, sign the letter.

Make sure that you skip at least four lines so that there’s enough room for your signature. After that, type out the name that has to be signed.

You can include your job title below your full name too.

Here is the format:

Your signature

 Typed full name

 Title

 Step 9: Enclosures (if applicable)

 If you plan to send anything along with your business letter, you can indicate this simply by writing Enclosures after the signature.

If you have included many documents, make a list that tells the recipient what he needs to look for in the envelope

 

Tips on writing Business Letters

 

1.       Keep it short and simple

Word choice can make or break the effectiveness of your business letter. Avoid flowery descriptions and jargon unless you are sure the recipient will understand what you are talking about. Keep the letter clear and concise. Get to the point as quickly as possible.

2.       Right Tone

Keep your tone conversational, yet professional. You don’t want to come off as arrogant or boastful. Save casual language for emails and messages-your printed business letters should be a little professional.

Tip:

Use verbs that have an active voice instead of passive. Active voice shows that you care and that you are responsible for your actions.

3.       Proofread, proofread, and proofread

As you might have already understood, a business letter is not the place to be sloppy. Triple-check it for spelling and  grammatical errors.  Also do not forget to review the spelling of your recipient’s name. If you spell it correctly, that will increase the chances of your letter winding up in the trash. At all costs, avoid grammatical mistakes. They suggest that you lack professionalism and attention to detail. Make sure to also do a spell check while you are at it.
