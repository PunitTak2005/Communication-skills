Perspectives in Communication Skills
Perspectives are ideas, views, or fixed ways of thinking. These sometimes affect our communication. For example, if you have a fixed idea that your teacher or father is strict, even when they are being friendly, you may think they are scolding you. In the same way, others may also have fixed ideas about you, which affects whatever you say to them.
