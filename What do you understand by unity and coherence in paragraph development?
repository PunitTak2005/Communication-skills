Unity and coherence in paragraph development refer to the principles that ensure a paragraph is well-structured, logical, and effective in conveying its message.

Unity:

- Means that the paragraph focuses on one main idea or topic.
- All sentences in the paragraph work together to support this central idea.
- The paragraph stays on track and doesn't deviate from the main point.

Coherence:

- Refers to the way sentences are connected to each other to form a logical and flowing paragraph.
- Sentences are linked through transitional words, phrases, and ideas that create a smooth progression.
- The paragraph is easy to follow, and the relationships between sentences are clear.

Together, unity and coherence help to:

- Create a clear and concise message
- Establish a logical flow of ideas
- Engage the reader and maintain their interest
- Ensure the paragraph is effective in conveying its purpose

By achieving unity and coherence, a paragraph becomes a cohesive and effective unit of writing.
