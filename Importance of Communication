Your ability to communicate clearly and share thoughts, feelings and ideas will help you in all your relations with other people. As a student, you may study any language, but it is important that you are able to read, write, speak and listen well in order to communicate properly. Speaking more than one language can help you to communicate well with people around the world. Learning English can help you to communicate with people who understand English besides the language you have been exposed to in your family, for example, your mother tongue. Communication skills are needed to •    Inform – for example, communicating the time of a meeting. •    Influence    – for example, negotiating with a shopkeeper to reduce the price. •    Express feelings – for example, to say or show that you are excited about your success or about a given task.
